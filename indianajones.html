        <p>
          Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures is a Lego-themed
          action-adventure video game developed by Traveller's Tales and
          published by LucasArts.The game allows players to recreate moments
          from the first three Indiana Jones films: Raiders of the Lost Ark
          (1981), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), and Indiana Jones
          and the Last Crusade (1989). It features the same cooperative play
          mode as seen in the Lego Star Wars video games, although it is
          restricted to local console play.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game was released on 3 June 2008 in the United States and Canada
          and 6 June in Europe. This game is based on the Lego Indiana Jones toy
          line. The Mac OS X version of the game was released on 4 December by
          Feral Interactive. As introduced in Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga,
          new moves include clinging onto branches during a jump using Indy's
          whip. As a promotion, Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga features
          Indiana Jones as an unlockable playable character.The game follows the
          events in the films, although some scenes from the film have been
          altered to allow for cooperative multiplayer play, to become more
          family-friendly, or just provide comic relief to the player.

                  The game follows the storylines from the original first three Indiana
                  Jones films: Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom and Last Crusade.
                  The game's developers divided the story from the films into six
                  chapters in the game, with each a story and a Freeplay mode as in the
                  traditional Lego gameplay. The story mode must be played first,
                  restricting the player from using preselected characters, from the
                  real scenes in the film, in the game, with the option to use any other
                  (unlocked) character during the Freeplay mode. These characters can
                  then be used to interact with the environment that other characters
                  sometimes cannot do during story mode to gain new items or find new
                  doorways, puzzles or game collectibles.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  Barnett College, Dr. Jones' teaching location from Last Crusade
                  (earlier known as "Marshall College" in the predecessors) serves as
                  the main hub of the game, and different maps on the walls allow access
                  to each of the missions, extra unlockable content and options are
                  found in the different classrooms. Once a player chooses a mission, a
                  cutscene begins that introduces the section of the movie being played.
                  Notable scenes have been recreated from the movies, such as the
                  memorable boulder escape, the battle on the rope bridge, or Walter
                  Donovan choosing the incorrect Holy Grail.
                </p>
                <p>There are 82 (standard) playable characters in total, 23 characters
                  that are given to players in the story and 59 characters that may be
                  purchased from the in-game Library. Then, there are the two custom
                  figures which can be made by the players, and the bonus character Han
                  Solo (much like Indiana Jones was a playable character in Lego Star
                  Wars: The Complete Saga). A few other characters can also be played
                  with the "Secret Characters" extra on, only playable on certain levels
                  (such as Santa Claus in "Into the Mountains" or Dancing girl 2 in
                  "Shanghai Showdown"). Each character featured in the game has his/her
                  own unique ability, which is required to access new areas when
                  replaying a level in Free Play mode. Lego Indiana Jones allows players
                  to mix and match parts to customize characters and make their own
                  creations like "Belloq Jones" or "Colonel Toht".</p>
                  <p>
                    LEGO Indiana Jones also allows players to customize characters and
                  make their own creations. In addition, players can play as their
                  custom creations in the Art Room to test their character's abilities.
                  However, all custom characters have the Whip ability, which may clash
                  with their custom character's appearance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    New features were added to the gameplay from the Lego Star Wars
                  series, such as the ability for the player to interact with objects in
                  their environment, e.g., bottles, swords, and guns. Players can also
                  build and ride vehicles. The game also incorporates character phobias
                  from the films; for example, if Indiana Jones sees a snake, Willie
                  sees a spider or Henry Jones Senior or Elsa see a rat, they will be
                  frozen with fear and have limited movement capacity until the animals
                  are either dead or out of range. Also, new melee attacks, such as the
                  Whip snag (trips enemies), have been added.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold topSpace">Nintendo DS</h2>
        <p>
          The DS version has some significant changes to accommodate both the
          memory and size limitations of the DS as well as its unique
          touchscreen controls. Characters' special abilities, such as Indy's
          whip or Satipo's shovel, and elements such as switches can be
          controlled by using the touch screen. In addition, the built-in
          microphone comes into play, allowing the player to physically blow out
          torches on some levels and inflate rubber rafts to cross water
          hazards.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are four classes of characters that can use special access
          panels to enter hidden areas; these all require the player to match a
          four-block sequence by solving a mini-puzzle on the touch screen.
          Scholars can access scroll panels and must flip pages in a book to
          find the correct blocks. Thuggee uses red skull panels and moves a
          torch to illuminate the blocks on a darkened screen. Military
          characters can use the green radio panels and scroll through a set of
          slot-machine wheels to match the pattern. Brotherhood characters enter
          the red sword panels and solve a block-switching game. In addition,
          Marion (and Monkey Man) can transform into a monkey on special red
          pads to climb to otherwise inaccessible areas and throw bottles of
          alcohol into flaming trash cans to blow up certain obstacles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DS version features cameos by Star Wars characters, including
          Wicket the Ewok and Luke Skywalker frozen in an ice cave resembling
          the Wampa's, but unlike the console versions, none of the characters
          are playable. Also, if the players chase Wicket, they might be able to
          kill him with one hit. In the final scene of "The Last Crusade", The
          Grail Knight is first shown as a shadow on the wall, which looks like
          Darth Vader; when the shadow draws a sword, the blade extends like a
          Lightsaber. Santa Claus, Strong Man, Castle Knight, and the Clown are
          the only non-movie characters who are unlockable. There are also no
          hidden levels or bonus rewards for completing the game at 100%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Red power bricks remain in the DS version, despite being replaced with
          red parcels in the console and PSP versions. Also, the characters do
          not suffer from fear of creatures as they do in the console versions.

          It was initially reported that the game would allow up to four players
          in co-operative mode, but this later turned out to be a
          miscommunication. While four characters may be visible on the screen,
          only two can be controlled by players. On the Nintendo DS, up to eight
          characters may be in the party, but only two may be visible on the
          screen. Neither the Xbox 360 version nor the PlayStation 3 version
          support online play through Xbox Live or the PlayStation Network. The
          Xbox 360 version is backwards compatible with Xbox One and the Xbox
          Series X.
        </p>
        <p>
          The music from the films was used in this game, but also some music
          was extracted from The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles e.g. "Attack of
          the Hawkmen" or "Daredevils of the Desert" or "Masks of Evil", etc.
          They were played in various scenes such as when Indy and Satipo
          approached the temple in "The Lost Temple", or when Indy, Willie and
          Short Round were preparing the mine cart in "Escape the Mines" or when
          Indy finds the true Grail in "Temple of the Grail". The original
          trilogy soundtrack would be used in Lego Indiana Jones 2: The
          Adventure Continues.

          PS3 and 7.7/10 for the PSP. which is similar to the Lego Star Wars
          games. X-Play gave it a 4 out of 5, saying that it has everything that
          a fan of the films could want, but it is not as fun as Lego Star Wars.
          Official PlayStation Magazine UK gave the game an 8/10, praising the
          immersive nature of the game, and praising the series' choices of
          source material. Official Nintendo Magazine gave the game 82%, just
          about the same as Lego Star Wars, saying it was very similar and not
          much has improved. Game Revolution gave the game B+, citing that the
          game, designed by fans of the movie series, provides "addictive game
          play" with "tons of replay value".
        </p>
        <p>
          The Nintendo DS version of Lego Indiana Jones was nominated for two
          DS-specific awards from IGN.com, namely Best Action Game[21] and Best
          Local Multiplayer Game.[22] The Wii version has also been nominated
